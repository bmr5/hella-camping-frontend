      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      Last Updated: Thursday, July 30th, 2020 These terms of service ("Terms")
      apply to your access and use of Campflare (the "Service"). Please read
      them carefully.
      <h2>Accepting these Terms</h2>
      If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of
      the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the
      terms. If you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the
      Service. Also, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by
      e-mailing contact@vay.co.
      <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
      We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we
      may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for
      some other reason. Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes
      are effective immediately after we post such revised Terms (indicated by
      revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we
      provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms
      (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your
      responsibility to check Campflare for changes to these Terms. If you
      continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then
      you have accepted the changes to these Terms.
      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      For information about how we collect and use information about users of
      the Service, please check out our privacy policy available at
      https://www.campflare.com/privacy.
      <h2>Questions & Contact Information</h2>

      address contact@vay.co.
